Final Project Submission on Household Income and CPI

This project looks at how inflation and income have changed over time in the U.S., using two datasets: the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and U.S. Household Income. We want to understand how inflation has affected income inequality and how different income groups—like the top 5% of earners compared to lower-income households—experience economic changes. By analyzing trends and key events, like economic downturns, we aim to uncover patterns in income growth, inequality, and recovery after crises. This research will help explain the relationship between inflation and income across decades.
