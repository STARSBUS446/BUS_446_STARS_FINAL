Final Project Submission on Household Income and CPI

This project looks at how inflation and income have changed over time in the U.S., using two datasets: the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and U.S. Household Income. We want to understand how inflation has affected income inequality and how different income groups—like the top 5% of earners compared to lower-income households—experience economic changes. By analyzing trends and key events, like economic downturns, we aim to uncover patterns in income growth, inequality, and recovery after crises. This research will help explain the relationship between inflation and income across decades.

The project repository is organized into four main sections. 
The Data folder contains the CPI and household income datasets used for analysis. 
The Visualization with Final Findings folder includes Tableau visualizations and detailed explanations of the insights they provide. 
The Code folder includes our regression analysis, showcasing the statistical models used to interpret the data. 
Lastly, the Business Case Report offers a comprehensive summary of the project's objectives, methodology, findings, and implications. 

By combining data analysis with visualization techniques, this project highlights the uneven effects of inflation across income groups and demonstrates how economic events influence income growth and inequality.
